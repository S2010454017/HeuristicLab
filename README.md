# Quellcode_Masterarbeit_Povolny

Contains the whole soure code created for the master thesis *Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)*. 

A plugin *ALNS* was created for [HeuristicLab](https://github.com/heal-research/HeuristicLab), extending it with an implementation of the *Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)* algorithm.

## How to build
Building using Visual Studio or SharpDevelop requires that you build the solutions in the correct order. The HeuristicLab 3.3.sln is quite large, please be patient until it is loaded.
The correct order to build:

 1. `HeuristicLab.ExtLibs.sln`
 2. `HeuristicLab 3.3.sln`
